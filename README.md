## Installation

This bot being self-hosted only, you'll need to create an application on
the [Discord Developper Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). Look it up, it's really not complicated.

Then you can copy your bot's token somewhere safe -- and I mean *really safe*, it's supposed to stay secret. You'll have
to put it in your configuration file later, so everything can work.
